    "# ☢️ Particle Decay and Time Dilation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook simulates how relativistic time dilation affects the observed **decay time** of fast-moving particles, particularly **muons** produced in Earth’s upper atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to their high speed (close to the speed of light), muons experience **slower time in their rest frame**, allowing them to reach the surface of Earth — despite their extremely short lifespans.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the most compelling real-world validations of **Einstein’s Special Relativity**."
