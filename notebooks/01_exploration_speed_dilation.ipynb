    "# ðŸš€ Time Dilation Due to High-Speed Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook dives deep into the effects of **special relativistic time dilation** â€” how time stretches for objects moving at velocities close to the speed of light. This phenomenon is central to **Special Relativity**, impacting particle physics, spaceflight, and technologies like GPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will:\n",
    "- Derive and compute the **Lorentz factor (Î³)**\n",
    "- Simulate time dilation at velocities from 0.1c to 0.99c\n",
    "- Visualize the relationship between speed and relativistic time\n",
    "- Analyze real-world implications and edge cases\n"
